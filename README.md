# Machine-learning-LinearRegression-train-by-gradient_descent-
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent from scratch in Python. The model predicts continuous numerical values by learning the optimal slope (m) and intercept (b) to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual values.
